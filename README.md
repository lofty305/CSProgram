Module 8 Portfolio

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address? 

This app was made to streamline the registration process for new students. The most important features are simplicity and functionality.

What did you do particularly well in developing this application? 

I think I was very meticulous in my hunt for bugs and proper syntax correction.

Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I think these UI designs were very straightforward and barebones feature-wise. This simple approach is what you would like to see in this case, as registering for classes should be quick and easy.

How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

I just read everything line by line and tried to abide by the new rules attributed to C#. This wasn't my first time programming so it was just a matter of translating the same concepts to a new language.

Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

Sometimes Intellisense would say there were no bugs but the program wouldnt run. That's when I understood that proofreading every line of code was essential to success. When I write my own code I will be mindful to check functionality in iteration as to keep tabs on any small errors that might be made.
